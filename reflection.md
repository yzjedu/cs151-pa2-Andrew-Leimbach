In this PA I was supposed to get practice with designing and programming functions, loops, testing code, error checking, and utilizing the many other aspects of Python we've learned so far.

Using what the class has learned from previous lectures, I followed the design process/steps in first understanding the readme in its full, developing an algorithm, reviewing it , test cases, and then developing the code. Key concepts explored were using functions, while loops, Booleans, as well as error checking.

My results did match what I expected. Because I heavily designed the program through my algorithm, it was easier to do the code and get the results we expected. I also developed multiple test cases, which helped me make sure the code worked well.

The challenges I faced during this assignment was developing an algorithm that was as complex as the one I had to develop. It was nice though to break down parts of the algorithm to simplify it. Its difficult working by myslef, as it is a lot of work to get done by myself. But overall, I enjoyed making this program as it is always fun to make something that you can play. I do believe I learned what I was supposed to and I'm happy with how my code turned out.
